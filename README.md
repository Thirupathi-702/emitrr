# 😸 Exploding Kitten

Explode Kitten is a web-based single-player card game inspired by the popular card game "Exploding Kittens". The objective of the game is to draw all 5 cards from a deck without drawing an exploding kitten card.

## Features

- A deck of 5 cards consisting of cat cards, defuse cards, shuffle cards, and exploding kitten cards.
- Clicking on the deck reveals a card, which is then removed from the deck.
- The game continues until all 5 cards are drawn or an exploding kitten card is drawn.
- Defuse cards can be used to defuse an exploding kitten card.
- Shuffle cards restart the game with a new deck.
- Automatically saves the game for a user at every stage so the user can continue from where he left off last time.
- Real-time update of points on the leaderboard for all the users if they are playing simultaneously using web sockets.
